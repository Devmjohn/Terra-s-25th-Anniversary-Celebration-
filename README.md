# 🌍 **Terra the Satellite**
*A Storytelling Space Journey — NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025*

---

## 🚀 Overview

**“Terra the Satellite”** is an interactive storytelling website built for the **NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025**.  
This project celebrates the **25th anniversary of the Terra satellite (1999–2024)** — one of NASA’s most iconic Earth observation missions.  

Through this digital experience, users are invited to explore the **life, data, and purpose** of Terra as if the satellite itself were telling its own story — from its launch in 1999 to its legacy in 2024 and beyond.

## 🛰️ Story Concept

> “Hello, I am Terra — your loyal observer for 25 years.  
> I’ve watched Earth breathe, burn, bloom, and heal.  
> From the orbit above, I’ve recorded every whisper of change,  
> not for myself, but for humanity.”  

The website transforms Terra’s 25-year journey into an immersive **AI-powered narrative**, highlighting milestones, achievements, and the impact of the instruments that made Terra revolutionary.

## 🔬 Terra’s Scientific Instruments

### 1. **ASTER (Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer)**
- **Purpose:** Captures high-resolution images of Earth’s surface in visible, thermal, and infrared light.  
- **Applications:** Land use mapping, volcano monitoring, glacier movement, and urban growth tracking.  

### 2. **CERES (Clouds and the Earth’s Radiant Energy System)**
- **Purpose:** Measures Earth’s energy balance — how much sunlight is absorbed and heat is emitted back.  
- **Applications:** Climate modeling, global temperature analysis, and atmospheric studies.  

### 3. **MISR (Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer)**
- **Purpose:** Observes Earth’s surface and clouds from multiple angles to measure aerosol and cloud properties.  
- **Applications:** Air quality studies, cloud motion tracking, and surface texture mapping.  

### 4. **MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer)**
- **Purpose:** The most famous of Terra’s instruments, MODIS scans the entire Earth every 1–2 days.  
- **Applications:** Ocean color, vegetation, wildfire detection, snow cover, and climate patterns.  

### 5. **MOPITT (Measurements of Pollution in the Troposphere)**
- **Purpose:** Measures carbon monoxide and other pollutants in the lower atmosphere.  
- **Applications:** Air pollution monitoring, atmospheric chemistry research, and tracking human impacts.
